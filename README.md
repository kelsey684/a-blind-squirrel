### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My initial intro to github experience . . .

<br>

It was Spring 2023. I stood 10 feet below, 'Assignment 2: Intro. to GitHub'. 
<br>

My task:

<br>
Step 2. 'Complete tutorials listed under Classroom'

Simple enough, or so I thought. . .

Just call me, 

**Tutorial Killer**

I have killed so many tutorial templates after I made so many edits and deletions. While the tutorials are killing me, I have killed my tutorial templates many times over.

I like . . . :laughing:
